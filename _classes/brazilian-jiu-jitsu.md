### **What is Brazilian Jiu Jitsu?**

Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a martial art, combat sport and a self-defense system created by the legendary Gracie family.

Jiu Jitsu emphasises taking an opponent to the ground and utilising ground fighting techniques and submission holds involving joint-locks and choke holds. The premise is that most of the advantage of a larger, stronger opponent comes from superior reach and more powerful strikes, both of which are somewhat negated when grappling on the ground.
