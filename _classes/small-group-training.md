## **I HAVE A LOW LEVEL OF FITNESS AND AM AFRAID OF MAKING A FOOL OF MYSELF?!**

First of all nobody care you cant do a proper push up or how good your burpees are. Everybody is to busy concentrating &nbsp;on what they are doing to even notice what you can or cant do. We design the programme in such a way that allows us to regress exercises also playing with other variables to make the programme more individual to each clients needs. Now saying that , If the client is carrying excess body weight or is suffering with severe mobility issues that prevent them from doing certain movements we may suggest a short One on One Personal Training Package before joining .
