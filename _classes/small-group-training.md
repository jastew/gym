## **WHAT IS SMALL GROUP PERSONAL TRAINING?**

&nbsp;

Small Group Personal Training is a community of like minded people chasing there strength and fitness goals together. Each training session is limited to six trainees per coach to ensure that everybody gets the attention they need. We warm up together, Sweat together and improve our lives together. Community is the heart of Primal Fitness, its what helps you push through those last few reps and what keeps you craving and coming back for more. The training programme is a scalable, progressive system that is changed every 6 weeks to keep the body guessing.

## **WHY SMALL GROUP PERSONAL TRAINING?**

&nbsp;

You can expect to get in the best shape of your life. Melt away 10 + unwanted pounds, get out of your big commercial gym for a not so traditional workout, and cut personal training fees by ¾. while still reaping the benefits. In fact most of the [transformation photos](/stories/) displayed on our website are a result of our small group personal training programme.

You can also expect to get better core strength and a tighter backside, as well as functional strength and agility, that apply to sports and everyday life.

The Primal Fitness small groups is nothing like your local commercial gym, the cheers are louder, smiles are bigger and expectations are higher. That’s why you’ll be able to do a little more, move a little faster and stick with it a lot longer.

## **I AM A FEMALE WHO WANTS TO START SMALL GROUP BUT DOESN’T FEEL COMFORTABLE TRAINING AROUND MEN?!**

&nbsp;

No problem, we have a number of “Woman only small group” that you can apply to join or you can start your own group with your friends/family.

Although the woman only programme has the exact same training philosophy and work ethic as the mens, the programme design differ a bit. In the woman’s programme there is alot more empathise on Glutes, hamstrings and building a stronger core (something we find alot woman starting out lack)

Primal girls are powerful, **passionate, vibrant, goal achieving, excellence pursuing bad ass chicks !** If your looking to get in the best shape of your life get in touch today!
