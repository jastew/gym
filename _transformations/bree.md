What does dedication look like?

It's hardwork, it's commitment, it's falling off the wagon but getting straight back on, it's trusting the process (something that a lot of people struggle with), it's getting to a Sunday morning class when you want to roll over and stay in bed. It's striving for progress every week instead of seeking perfection.

Here's Danielles impressive transformation.

Danielle started her weightloss journey before she came to Primal, joining a well known club where people go, get weighed etc etc(we all know the one) and made great progress. Then made the decision to step up her game, continue her weightloss journey and start a strength and fitness journey too.

And as you can see absolutely killed it. Training 3 or 4 times a week with training partners that she didn't know before joining but I know they're considered mates now.
Apart from the physical changes in Danielle, her mindset towards food, strength, fitness and weighing scales has changed big time.

(I'm just as proud of this change in her as I am the physical change)
Over the past few months Danielle has drifted away from the scales and instead, started to focus on the weight that she can lift! And that's quite a bit of weight now by the way..... deadlifts 100+kg, squats her bodyweight better than most for multiple reps and sets.

Focus on this stuff and the rest takes care of itself.
Awesome Danielle, I know you'll keep up the great work.
