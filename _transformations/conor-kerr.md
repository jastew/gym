Conor Kerr has been training private at Primal fitness for a few months now and has gained slabs of muscle, got a hell of alot stronger whilst losing a ton of bodyfat.

Id also like to add that since day 1 Conor has not lost a single kg on the scales but is a total different shape then when he first started (Post on why scales dont matter when it comes to improving body composition coming soon)

Just a few strength jumps Conor made:
<br>.Bench press 1RM- 85kg to 116kg (tested last month)

.Struggled to do a few chin ups at the start,now he can do 15+ overhand lockout pull ups

.Couldnt hold the 40kg kettlebell for squats at the start,now he can squat it as a warm up its that easy

Me and kerr have been friends since we were children and personaly its great to see such a dramatic change in him,he looks incredible and more importantly hes the happiest ive ever seen him!
