Here is Andy Roach (or as we like to call him "The monster") after 11 weeks personal training at Primal Fitness.

Andy came to me with a pretty bad lower back injury what restricted him from doing alot of exercises such as squats,deadlifts,planks or any ab exercise which required flexion of his trunk.

This minor road block didnt stop Andy from smashing all of his goals on the wall which included a 25kg increase in his bench press and 15 strict chin ups (he couldnt even do one on his first day)

Andys results speak for themselves,id also like to mention that Andy was a pleasure to train and even though he looks like he'd rip the roof of your car off and eat you he is an absoulte gentlemen!

Job well done Andy ,enjoy the holiday you deserve it!!&nbsp;
