Here is the progress photos from Philips 12 week Program and the results speak for themselves.

Phil went from a 150kg deadlift to 210kg,80kg bench press to 120kg and pushing 350kg on the prowler (A gym record)

Not only that Phil has noticed a MASSIVE improvement in his posture compared to when he first started.

I suppose he lost a bit of fat too. . .ðŸ˜‚

Well done Phil great job&nbsp;
