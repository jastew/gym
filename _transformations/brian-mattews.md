Brian's amazing transformation

Both physically and with his attitude towards training and nutrition.

Before starting Brian was very anxious about coming down to us….fear of the unknown I suppose, which is very common. But being tired of having no energy, being overweight and knowing he was unhealthy he finally bit the bullet and came down. I know he'll tell you himself he hasn't looked back since….

The man is now a beast!

The List is endless of his improvements, not being able to do one chin up to sets of weighted chin ups, same with dips (videos to follow) squats and deadlifts anything I put on the bar. And seems to never tire when doing hiit training.

Brian gives 100% to everything, from his nutrition to his training……never missing a day and always wanting to do extra sessions. (Can't keep him out of the place)

It's been a pleasure watching him literally transform into the machine he is today in a few short weeks.

We're not too pushed on the scales here in primal, but I think it's over the 20kg of fatloss.

Savage work Brian.
