These pictures of Shon are 5 weeks apart.

As you can see from the photos he got amazing aesthetic results but they still do not tell the full story.

When sean first started he could not do a bodyweight squat or get in a squat position without getting agonizing pain in his lower back (this is with no weight).He now squats the 40kg kettlebell 12 times,for multiple sets,ass to grass and PAIN FREE.

He orginally hurt his back trying to deadlift 90kg in a local gym in Drogheda.Just the other day in Primal he deadlifted 150Kg like it was nothing! (Knowhere near his max)

The only downside to this transformation is our failing efforts to try getsean to cut his hair for the after pictures but he was having none of it!! :-)

Well done sean you done amazing and worked like a warrior!We are sure youl "darkin" the Primal door with your presence again
