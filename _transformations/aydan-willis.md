Here is a before and after picture of Aydan Willis.I could write a 500 page essay on how much this man has changed on the inside and out,but instead il show you a small testimony of aydans journey from the man himself-

-"I was constantly sick and I was in and out of doctors and the hospital on a regular basis.

I used to sit in my room all day playing the playstation,I barely ate and struggled to sleep at night.

I had zero confidence and felt like I could do nothing for myself because I was so shy.

With the way things were going I honestly think I would be dead by now if I had not of met Ben

I now feel like a different person and much more healthy in my body and my head.

I am much more social and confident and have made loads of good friends through the gym.

I have recently competed in my first weight lifting competition and I am doing my FAI soccer coaching badges in the new year (something that I would never of had the confidence to do) and I couldnt be happier in myself.

I can honestly say Ben changed my life!"

Id like to say a big thank you to aydan for writing such a personal testimony and making it public.It really is an amazing story and on behalf of primal id like say we are proud of ya aydo!!
