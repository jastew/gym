Robyn came into me 12 weeks ago like most girls, wanting to drop a few pounds, tone up, get fitter, and have a bit more shape.

Look at what she achieved..... Amazing results!

Robyn as she will tell you herself was never the most enthusiastic person when it came to exercise... in her own words, "I'm a lazy bi@#h"

Now though, seeing what smart training can achieve I think she doesn't mind it, il even go as far as to say, enjoy the training.

Not only has the 12 weeks given her body fantastic shape, but Robyn is now incredibly strong, 1 rpm deadlift an easy 115kg
<br>Chin ups for reps
<br>Push ups for reps
<br>List goes on....

If you want great results,
<br>Do as Robyn done, stick to a simple nutrition plan and show up 3 times a week for training.
<br>We will do the rest!

Well done again Robyn, super results!
