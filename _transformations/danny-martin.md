Here we have Danny's super transformation.

Coming in the door first Danny's goal was to simply 'get bigger and stronger'

And he done just that, packing on an impressive 10kg, going from 'the skinny guy' to as you can see bit of a beast üëâüèº(beginner to beast program)

From struggling to do bodyweight exercises on the first day, to being able to do multiple sets of chin ups, dips, he'll do push ups for days, squats/deadlifts/benches with perfect form, list goes on.

Danny's program and nutrition plan will now be tweaked, and we will see some abs popping (cutting phase)

Happens to be his birthday this week too... Happy birthday Danny and savage work as always.
