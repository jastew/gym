Superhuman by Habit is a great book that explains how to nail your goals, one tiny habit at a time. The book is about building good habits, prioritising what habits to work on, and not falling off the wagon along the way. All the points made in this article are inspired by this book.

##### **Habit beat Willpower**

A habit is a set of behaviours put on autopilot, meaning we do the task with very little effort. Willpower on the other hand is like fuel in your car, it will eventually run out.

By creating habits, we can move things from the “hard” to “easy”, thus freeing up willpower to tackle more of the hard things.

This takes effort, but establishing most habits takes the relatively short time of one to twelve months.
