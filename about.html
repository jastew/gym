The gyms warm and friendly atmosphere.</strong></p><p>We understand how intimidating joining a gym can be , this is one of the reasons why Primal Fitness was created. We wanted to create an environment for people to come to leave the stress of everyday life , and take an hour just for themselves. Here , you can surround yourself with a community of positive , friendly people , Where each person cheers on the next and helps one another to reach there goal.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>3. The semi-private experience .</strong></p><p>Some people work well in a commercial gym and are happy to go about following a program from month to month.</p><p>But that's how we differ....</p><p>We cater for the person who has been putting in the effort for months maybe years and not getting the results they deserve.</p><p>The client who has mobility issues, injuries, some clients even going through rehab with a shoulder or knee.</p><p>We can and will customise your program to suit your ability and needs.</p><p>We cater for the client that needs the accountability and extra bit of motivation to follow through with a program&nbsp;</p><p>We have catered for clients from all walks of life, the complete beginner, the athlete, the mother getting her foot back on the fitness ladder, the busy business man thar still wants to make time to train, the men and women who think they are too old and can't train in a gym but become some of our most dedicated members. No two of our clients are the same so we don't treat them that way. That is what makes the foundation to our training methods</p></div>
