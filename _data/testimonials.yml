  quote: "When I first came into Ben, he told me what he could do for me. I was excited. My lifestyle wasn't the best. I was drinking a lot, smoking, eating whatever I could find and I wasn't active. Any typical gym I was going to was just making me do cardio for an hour and told me that I wasn't ready to do weights until I'd lost 2 or 3 stone from the cardio. They used BMI as gospel and made you weigh yourself regularly. Ben told me that all of this was a load of sh*te and designed a program that catered to me specifically. 1st training session, I was in tatters after the warm up. I couldn't get into a squat position without my back hurting. I was having second thoughts that I would be wasting my money training with back trouble but I trusted Ben. He helped me train at my own pace.Over the course of 6 weeks, I was able to squat without back pain to a point where I was doing sets of 12 with a 40kg kettlebell. I put goals up on a wall along with everyone else. I beat all of my goals. I deliberately made my goals difficult for myself and to my surprise, exceeded my own expectations. I think this aspect of the program works wonders for one's confidence. It's a huge boost to have a person see something in you that you can't see in yourself and being able to release this yourself. The 6 weeks I did with Ben has helped me psychologically, done wonders for my self esteem and even improved my posture. The best part of Primal Fitness is the lads actually care about your progress and well being. They're not just in it for your money or to show off how strong they are etc etc. Real down to earth lads and I wish them loads of success. Thanks for improving my life Ben and Walshy. Sean"

  quote: "So I am just after finishing the 12 weeks transformation here and I am amazed at the results thanks to Stephen.  I started here heading in a bad way health wise I was very heavy and steadily getting worse and was probably at risk of diabetes and other illnesses. I had been trying exercise and healthy eating on and off for a few years nothing seemed to get me the results I would want and I would just give up. I decided to give primal a shot and sent them a message they told me what they could do for me and all the other details and I signed up the week after. The first day of training was the toughest I had done in my life I couldn't even manage the whole hour. After that I steadily got fitter and fitter dropping pounds like nothing else and more importantly getting fitter and getting a bit of a shape to my body. The lads made it so easy to enjoy training and want to eat better and push that bit harder each session and before I knew it I was loving working out which I never had before. The changes to my life have been extraordinary being fitter and stronger makes everything easier to do from walking round to reaching picking something up from the floor. I couldn't have done this without Stephen and primal fitness. I would definitely recommend primal to anyone looking to get fit and healthy while still enjoying yourself."

  quote: "Joining primal fitness was one of the best decisions I have made in a long time. Training on your own can be quite difficult and I no myself I wouldn't have done half the stuff I done in that 12 weeks if it wasn't for the constant encouragement from the lads. It was gruesome at times but also thoroughly enjoyable. That enjoyable that I have signed back up to go again for another 12 in January. If your looking to improve any aspect of your physical health the boys have the answers. Be it nutrition or techniques, the lads will tailor each program to meet your exact needs. If you're in two minds, don't hesitate you won't regret it, it's also great crack down the gym too"

  quote: "I love this gym and would be lost without it now! When I decided to do my first six weeks here I was so nervous and didn't know what to expect. From day one it has been such a welcoming and friendly environment unlike any other gym I've been to before. Anna, Ben & Walshy are the best trainers out there, always pushing you to do the best you can in such an encouraging way. I couldn't recommend them highly enough! I've already signed up for another 6 weeks to get my ass kicked even more and I cannot wait to start again. It has given me so much confidence and the opportunity to meet the best group of people I can now call my friends. I really couldn't ask for a better place to train. If you're looking for plenty of laughs, loads of fun and routines that keep you motivated this is your place. Trust me you won't regret it! #PrimalFitFamForLife"

We trained in all weather conditions, there was never an excuse, results are results. Ben's passion for training and dietary goes beyond the norm, he instills a passion in his clients that is unparelled. The perfect Bonnie to Clyde/ Clyde to Bonnie is, Walshy, I have trained with him so many times and he never fails to impress me. His dedication and enthusiasm to achieve are traits only seen in a true athlete. Combining their fitness traits and will to achieve, you will get what you want, fitness, good health and a more rounded positive view on life!"

  quote: 'am currently on week 7 of a 12 week programme at Primal Fitness. I would highly recommend Primal to anyone in all walks of life. Stephen & Ben devote 100% commitment and dedication to all their clients.! On starting at Primal i had a terrible diet and poor fitness levels, this all changed when Stephen set me up on a new diet plan and started me on a training programme. My energy levels have shot up and my diet is now much improved, the difference in such a short time is amazing. When my 12 weeks in primal are finished i will 100% be signing up again. Best thing ive ever done, keep up the excellent work lads'
